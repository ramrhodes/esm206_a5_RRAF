# Introduction


Salamander and trout populations in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest have been monitored for over 20 years in an effort to record long-term population trends related to land use. Pacific giant salamanders (genus *Dicamptodon*) are endemic to the Pacific Northwest and include four distinct species, three of which were differentiated from each other in 1989. Coastal giant salamanders (*Dicamptodon tenebrosus*) were monitored at Mack Creek in Andrews Experimental Forest. This analysis examines abundance and weights of salamanders for different sections (clear cut and old growth forests) and types of habitat (pools, cascades, and side-channels). Land use and disturbance affect wildlife in different ways, and research is ongoing in these areas. The data analyzed in this report attempts to determine if significant associations exist between salamander abundance, weight, and forest sections. (???!!)

# Data and Methods

Researchers from the Andrews Forest LTER site have collected data from 1993 - 2017 on the abundance, length, weight and habitat dimensions of Pacific Giant Salamanders (*Dicamptodon tenebrosus*) at two sites in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest; one of the sites was a section that was clearcut in 1963 and the other site was a 500 year old coniferous forest located further upstream. Researchers collected data annually at the same 150 meter reaches of stream using 2-pass electrofishing. The effects of section type (clear cut or old growth) on the abundance of Pacific Giant Salamander was tested using a Chi-square test.  The weights of Pacific Giant Salamanders found in each site were compared using two-sided, two sample t-tests witha 95% confidence interval and Cohen's d. All analyses and figures were prepared using R software version 3.6.1.

# Results 

### 1. Annual salamander abundance in clear cut and old growth forest sections

The number of Pacific giant salamanders in clear cut and old growth forests were recorded each year at Mack Creek between 1993 and 2017 (Figure 1). In both sections of forest, salamander abundance increased from 1993 to 2017. The number of salamanders found in the clear cut section increased from 126 in 1993 to 368 by 2017 (192% increase). The number of salamanders found in the old growth section increased from 129 to 328 in the time period (154% increase). The two sections generally follow the same trends, with similar dips and peaks. Until 2014, most years had higher salamander abundance in old growth forest sections than in clear-cut sections.

***Figure 1.*** *Changes in annual California Giant Salamander abundance (counts) in sections of clear cut forest (orange) and sections of old growth forest (green) from 1993 to 2017. Total salamander counts in 1993: clear cut(n) = 126, old growth(n) = 129. Total salamander counts in 2017: clear cut(n) = 368, old growth(n) = 328.* 


### 2. Abundance of salamander in each section by channel classifications

Based on the observations recorded from 2017, the proportions of Pacific giant salamander found in different channel classifications (cascade, pool, or side-channel) were calculated within both the clear cut and old growth sections of Mack Creek (Table 1).  Notably, the proportions of salamanders found in the different channel classifications was similar across both forest condtions. In both clear cut and old growth sections, salamander abundance was highest in cascades, lowest in pools, and were almost equal in side-channels, comprising 24% and 23% respectively.

#   geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
#   facet_wrap(~section)

## Results C Statistical Test 

# Regarding the locations where salamanders were observed in Mack Creek in 2017, is there a significant effect of forest condition on where the channel salamanders are found?

# Use Chi-square test (see lab 8 and lecture 14)

chi_counts <- s_channel_table %>% 
  select(-section)

chi_counts

s_chi_counts <- chisq.test(chi_counts)

s_chi_counts


```

For both forest condtions, abundance (counts) and proprtions of salanmander found in each channel classification were compared (Table 1). Salamanderes in the clear cut section seemed to prefer cascades (67%, n =247) and disliked pools (8%, n = 31) compared to salamanders in the old growth section that favored pools more (14%, n = 45), but still overall preferred cascades (63%, n=201).  While the abundnace of salamanders in the different channel classifications was slightly different between the two sections, the proprotions were fairly similar across both forest conditions. A Pearson's Chi-square test was used to determine that forest conditions does not have has an effect on where salamanders are located within the channel (*p* = `r round(s_chi_counts$p.value, 3)`).There is no clear association between section type and salamander location within the channel. 


### 4. Salamander weights in clear cut and old growth forest sections in 2017

# Results D 

## Results D Data Exploration
ggplot(s_weight_section, aes(x = weight, y = section)) +
  geom_jitter()

salamanders_summary_weight <- salamanders %>%
  group_by(section) %>%
  filter(year == "2017") %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
    se_weight = sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(n()),
    var_weight = var(weight, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) ### Our means in this summary table dont match up with means calculated below from vectors. I dont know why!

## Make vectors for statistical tests

cc_weight <- s_weight_section %>% 
  filter(section == "CC") %>% 
  pull(weight)

og_weight <- s_weight_section %>% 
  filter(section == "OG") %>% 
  pull(weight)

cc_mean_weight <- mean(cc_weight)

og_mean_weight <- mean(og_weight, na.rm = TRUE)

weight_ttest <- t.test(cc_weight,og_weight)

weight_ttest

# Let's also run Cohen's d for effect size

weight_d <- effsize::cohen.d(cc_weight,og_weight, na.rm =TRUE)

weight_d

# Cannot reject the null hypothesis 


```

Salamander weights (grams) were compared between clear cut and old growth forest sections in 2017. The mean salamander weight in clear cut forest sections was `r round(cc_mean_weight, 2)` g and the mean weight in old growth forests was `r round(og_mean_weight, 2)` g. This difference in means of `r round(cc_mean_weight, 2) - round(og_mean_weight, 2)` g was found to be insignificant, using a two-sample t-test (t(`r round(weight_ttest$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(weight_ttest$statistic, 2)`, *p* = `r round(weight_ttest$p.value, 3)`) with a negligible effect size (Cohen's *d* = `r round(weight_d$estimate, 2)`). Salamander weights do not differ significantly based on forest condition. 


### 5. Salamander weights in three channel classifications in 2017

***Figure 2.*** *Salamander weights (g) by channel classification in 2017. bla bla bla indicates mean, and something about standard deviation and/or standard error........* 

Mean weights for salamanders were compared between the three channel classifications. Using a one-way ANOVA test, it was determined that at least two of the mean weights were not equal (in line referencing...`r weight_ANOVA$p.value` (this didnt work)). To determine which channel classifications differed in mean weights, a post-hoc Tukey's HSD test was conducted. The results from this indicated that mean weights differed significantly between side-channels and pools, but there was no significant difference in mean weights between pools and cascades and between side-channels and cascades. (in line referencing!). Overall, the only real difference in mean salamander weights based on channel classification was between side-channels and pools. 

If this analysis were to move forward, it would be advisable to compare other metrics rather than just means between groups. Means are affected by outliers, and, as seen in Figure 2, all groups had a few outliers with high weights. It could be helpful to conduct a rank-based test in addition to comparing means between groups. ?????


# Summary

- Salamander abundance increased in both clear cut and old growth forest sections between 1993 and 2017
- Salamander abundance in different channel classifications (cascades, pools, and side-channels) in 2017 is not associated with or affected by forest condition (clear cut or old growth)
- Salamander weight differences between clear cut and old growth forest sections in 2017 were insignificant
- There was a significant difference in weights between salamanders found in side-channels and pools in 2017
- Overall, in terms of abundance and weights, forest disturbance did not seem to have significant effects on salamanders (???? too much to assume, or..,??)
